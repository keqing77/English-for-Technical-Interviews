## Script
Today we will use DFS + backtracking to solve this problem. Basically we need to explore all possible paths from the root node to the leaf node and see if their sum is equal to the target sum. For each node, we use DFS way to track the current sum and all nodes we have gone through. We put those nodes into a list called current path. Once we hit the leaf node, we check if the current sum equals to the target, if so, then we add the current path list to the result to be returned later.  
So another crucial part is, at the end of the DFS function, we need to remove the last node from the current path list, which is called backtracking. So why we need to remove the last node is that we don’t want to consider this case anymore, either because it led to the dead-end, or they have already been explored. Therefore, we undo this choice and we will explore other paths later.

So before starting the DFS, we need to initialize the targetsum as a global variable. Then in the DFS, we can see the base case for this DFS function is to check if the current node is null. If so, we directly terminate the function.
Then we update the current sum by adding the current node’s value, and then update the current path list by adding the current node.
Then if the current node is a leaf node, we can check if the overall sum is equal to the target one. If so, that is one of the valid results to be returned, we add it to the result list.
If not the leaf node, that means we can keep doing tree traversal to go down. We can either choose to go left or go right. After exploring all possible paths starting from the current node, then we do a backtrack to undo the last node added to the path list, which is just the current node.
